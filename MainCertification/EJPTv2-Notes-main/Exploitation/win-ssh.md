# SSH

- port: 22
- SSH uses legitimate user account for access.
- most exploits affect openssh 7.2
- use hydra to brute force
- `hydra -l <user> -P <passlist> <ip> ssh`
- once obtained access to any ssh account - use auxiliary/ssh/ssh_login in msf
- then upgrade to meterpreter (may not work on unsupported architecture)
- if in a bourne shell - run "bash" command to get standard windows shell
