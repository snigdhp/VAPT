# What is CEH?
CEH stands for Certified Ethical Hacker. It's a certification program aimed at individuals who want to become skilled in identifying and resolving vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks. Ethical hackers, often referred to as "white-hat hackers," use their knowledge and skills to improve cybersecurity by finding and fixing weaknesses before malicious hackers can exploit them.

## What do Certified Ethical Hackers do?
- Identify Vulnerabilities: CEHs are trained to identify weaknesses in computer systems, networks, applications, and other digital assets that could be exploited by cyber attackers.
- Perform Penetration Testing: They conduct controlled attacks, known as penetration tests or pen tests, to simulate real-world cyber attacks and assess the security posture of an organization's systems and networks.
- Assess Security Measures: CEHs evaluate existing security measures, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus software, to determine their effectiveness in protecting against cyber threats.
- Provide Recommendations: Based on their findings, CEHs provide recommendations and strategies to improve cybersecurity defenses and mitigate vulnerabilities, helping organizations strengthen their overall security posture.
## How do you become a Certified Ethical Hacker?
To become a Certified Ethical Hacker, individuals typically undergo formal training through accredited programs or self-study using resources like textbooks, online courses, and practice exams. Once they feel prepared, they can then take the CEH certification exam, which tests their knowledge and skills in various areas of ethical hacking.

## Why is CEH important?
- Cybersecurity Skills Shortage: With the increasing frequency and sophistication of cyber attacks, there's a growing demand for skilled cybersecurity professionals who can help organizations defend against threats.
- Proactive Security Measures: CEHs play a crucial role in proactively identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious actors, helping to prevent data breaches and other cyber incidents.
- Compliance Requirements: Many industries and regulatory frameworks require organizations to conduct regular security assessments and implement adequate cybersecurity measures. CEHs can assist in meeting these compliance requirements by conducting thorough security assessments and providing recommendations for improvement.
- Ethical Hacking Community: CEHs are part of a global community of cybersecurity professionals dedicated to ethical hacking and improving cybersecurity practices worldwide. By obtaining the CEH certification, individuals demonstrate their commitment to ethical conduct and ongoing professional development in the field of cybersecurity.

In summary, Certified Ethical Hackers play a vital role in helping organizations protect their digital assets and data from cyber threats. By leveraging their skills and expertise in ethical hacking, CEHs contribute to the ongoing effort to enhance cybersecurity and safeguard against malicious activities in an increasingly interconnected digital world.
