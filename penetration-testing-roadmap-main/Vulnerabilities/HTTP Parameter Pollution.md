# What is HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP)?
HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker manipulates or injects additional parameters into HTTP requests, leading to unexpected behavior or security issues in web applications.

## How Does HTTP Parameter Pollution Work?
- HTTP Requests: When a user interacts with a web application, their browser sends HTTP requests to the server to retrieve or submit data.

- Query Parameters: HTTP requests often include query parameters in the URL, such as ?param1=value1&param2=value2, which the server uses to process the request.

- Manipulation: Attackers manipulate these query parameters by injecting additional values or duplicating existing parameters in the request, potentially altering the behavior of the web application.

- Impact: Depending on how the application processes the HTTP parameters, HTTP Parameter Pollution can lead to a range of security issues, such as bypassing security controls, data manipulation, or server-side code execution.

## Example Scenario
Suppose a web application uses a URL like example.com/search?query=keyword to perform searches based on user input. An attacker could manipulate this URL by injecting additional parameters, such as example.com/search?query=keyword&param2=value2, causing the server to process unexpected parameters along with the search query. Depending on how the application handles these parameters, the attacker could exploit vulnerabilities like SQL injection or bypass access controls.

## Impact of HTTP Parameter Pollution
- Data Corruption: HPP can cause data corruption or inconsistency by altering the values of parameters used by the application.

- Security Bypass: Attackers may exploit HPP vulnerabilities to bypass security controls, access unauthorized resources, or perform actions beyond their privileges.

- Injection Attacks: HPP can facilitate other injection attacks, such as SQL injection or command injection, by manipulating parameters passed to backend systems.

## Mitigating HTTP Parameter Pollution
- Input Validation: Validate and sanitize user input to prevent injection of additional parameters or manipulation of existing parameters in HTTP requests.

- Parameter Whitelisting: Define a whitelist of expected parameters and values, rejecting any unexpected or duplicate parameters in HTTP requests.

- Request Normalization: Normalize HTTP requests to remove duplicate or conflicting parameters, ensuring consistent processing by the application.

- Security Controls: Implement access controls, authentication mechanisms, and proper error handling to mitigate the impact of HPP vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion
HTTP Parameter Pollution is a security vulnerability that occurs when attackers manipulate or inject additional parameters into HTTP requests, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security issues in web applications. By understanding how HPP works and implementing appropriate security measures such as input validation, parameter whitelisting, and request normalization, developers can mitigate the risk of exploitation and protect their applications from malicious attacks. Regular security assessments and updates are essential for maintaining a secure web application environment.
