# What is DNS Cache Poisoning?
DNS Cache Poisoning is a cyber attack where attackers manipulate the DNS (Domain Name System) cache of a recursive DNS resolver to redirect users to malicious websites or servers. By injecting false DNS records into the cache, attackers can deceive users' devices into connecting to incorrect IP addresses, leading to various security risks.

## How Does DNS Cache Poisoning Work?
- Domain Name System (DNS): DNS is like a phonebook for the internet, translating domain names (e.g., example.com) into IP addresses (e.g., 192.0.2.1) that computers understand.

- Caching: DNS resolvers cache DNS records to speed up the process of translating domain names into IP addresses. When a user's device requests the IP address for a domain, the resolver first checks its cache before querying authoritative DNS servers.

- Attack: Attackers send fraudulent DNS responses to the resolver, containing incorrect IP addresses mapped to legitimate domain names. When the resolver caches these false records, subsequent DNS queries from users are redirected to the attacker-controlled IP addresses instead of the legitimate servers.

- Redirected Traffic: Users unknowingly connect to the attacker-controlled servers, which may host phishing pages, malware, or other malicious content. This can lead to data theft, malware infections, or other security breaches.

## Example Scenario
Imagine a user wants to visit a legitimate banking website, but an attacker has poisoned the DNS cache of their ISP's resolver. When the user's device requests the IP address for the banking website, the resolver returns a fraudulent IP address controlled by the attacker. As a result, the user is redirected to a fake banking website that looks identical to the real one but is operated by the attacker to steal login credentials and sensitive information.

## Impact of DNS Cache Poisoning
- Phishing Attacks: Attackers can redirect users to fake websites designed to steal login credentials, financial information, or personal data.

- Malware Distribution: DNS cache poisoning can lead to users unknowingly downloading malware from attacker-controlled servers, compromising the security of their devices and networks.

- Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: Attackers can intercept and manipulate communications between users and legitimate servers, eavesdropping on sensitive information or injecting malicious content into web pages.

## Mitigating DNS Cache Poisoning
- DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions): Implement DNSSEC to digitally sign DNS records and validate their authenticity, preventing DNS cache poisoning attacks.

- DNS Caching Best Practices: Configure DNS resolvers to cache DNS records securely, limiting the duration of cached records and validating responses from authoritative DNS servers.

- Network Segmentation: Segment networks to isolate critical systems from potentially compromised devices, reducing the impact of DNS cache poisoning attacks on the entire network.

- Regular Security Updates: Keep DNS software and infrastructure up to date with the latest security patches and updates to mitigate known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

## Conclusion
DNS Cache Poisoning is a serious security threat that can lead to phishing attacks, malware distribution, and man-in-the-middle attacks. By implementing security measures such as DNSSEC, DNS caching best practices, network segmentation, and regular security updates, organizations can mitigate the risk of exploitation and protect their users and networks from malicious DNS manipulation. Regular monitoring and response to suspicious DNS activity are also essential for maintaining a secure DNS infrastructure.
