# Types of Networks

Networks are essentially interconnected systems that allow communication and resource sharing among various devices. Here are some common types of networks:

## LAN (Local Area Network):

- Definition: A Local Area Network is a network that covers a small geographic area, like a single building or a campus.
- Example: Your home Wi-Fi network or the network within your school or office.
## WAN (Wide Area Network):

- Definition: A Wide Area Network spans a larger geographic area and connects multiple LANs. It can cover cities, countries, or even continents.
- Example: The internet itself is the largest WAN. It connects LANs from all around the world.
## MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):

- Definition: A Metropolitan Area Network falls between LANs and WANs in terms of geographic coverage. It typically covers a city or a large campus.
- Example: A network connecting multiple offices of a company within a city.
## Wireless Networks:

- Definition: These networks use wireless communication technologies like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or cellular networks to connect devices without the need for physical cables.
- Example: Wi-Fi networks in homes or public places, Bluetooth connections between your phone and other devices.
## Internet:

- Definition: The internet is a global network of networks, connecting millions of devices worldwide. It uses a variety of technologies, including wired and wireless connections.
- Example: When you access websites, send emails, or use online services, you're using the internet.
## Intranet:

- Definition: An intranet is a private network within an organization. It uses the same technologies as the internet but is limited to internal use.
- Example: The internal network within a company that employees use for sharing information and resources.
## Extranet:

- Definition: An extranet is an extension of an intranet that allows limited access to external users, such as clients or partners.
- Example: A company's extranet might allow its clients to access specific project information.
## Client-Server Network:

- Definition: In a client-server network, there are dedicated servers that provide services or resources, and client devices that request and use those resources.
- Example: When you access a website (client), you are making requests to a server that hosts the website.
## Peer-to-Peer Network:

- Definition: In a peer-to-peer network, devices are equal and can communicate directly with each other, sharing resources without a central server.
- Example: File sharing between two computers without a dedicated server.

Understanding these basic types of networks can provide you with a foundation for learning more about the complexities and nuances of networking.
