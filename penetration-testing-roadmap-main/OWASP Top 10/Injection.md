# Injection
Injection is a type of security vulnerability that arises when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. In simpler terms, it's like a sneaky way for attackers to inject harmful code into a system, usually through forms or input fields on a website.

## What is Injection? 
Injection occurs when an attacker inserts malicious data, often in the form of code, into a place where the application processes or interprets it. This can happen with various types of data, such as user inputs in search boxes, login forms, or any field where the application is supposed to accept information.

## Common Types of Injection Attacks
- SQL Injection (SQLi): This is like tricking a database into running unintended SQL code. For example, if a login form is not properly secured, an attacker might input something like ' OR '1'='1' -- to gain unauthorized access.
- Command Injection: In this case, attackers inject commands into the input fields that the system uses to execute commands. If not properly handled, it's like letting someone run commands on your computer remotely.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): While not always categorized under Injection, it's worth mentioning. XSS involves injecting malicious scripts into web pages that are then executed by the victim's browser. It's like slipping a harmful note into a letter someone else is reading.

## Why is Injection a Problem?
If an application doesn't properly validate and sanitize input, attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on the server or manipulate the behavior of the application. This could lead to unauthorized access, data loss, or other security issues.

## Preventing Injection Attacks 
Developers can prevent injection attacks by validating and sanitizing user inputs. Using parameterized queries in databases, validating and encoding data, and implementing security controls like Content Security Policy (CSP) for web applications are essential measures.

Injection vulnerabilities are high on the OWASP Top 10 list because they are prevalent and can have severe consequences. An attacker gaining unauthorized access or manipulating the system through injection can lead to data breaches, service disruptions, and more.

Injection is about ensuring that the inputs a system receives are thoroughly checked and sanitized to prevent attackers from injecting malicious code. It's like making sure you thoroughly inspect and clean anything before allowing it into your house to avoid unwanted surprises.
