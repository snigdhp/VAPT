# OWASP Top 10
OWASP stands for the Open Web Application Security Project, and the OWASP Top 10 is a list of the most critical web application security risks. These risks are compiled by security experts from around the world to help developers, security professionals, and organizations prioritize and address the most pressing threats to web applications.

## Injection (A1):

- What it is: Injection attacks occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. This can lead to unauthorized access to databases and other systems.
- Example: SQL injection, where an attacker manipulates input to execute malicious SQL queries.
## Broken Authentication (A2):

- What it is: This refers to weaknesses in the mechanisms for user authentication and session management. If not properly implemented, it can lead to unauthorized access.
- Example: Weak password policies, session hijacking.
## Sensitive Data Exposure (A3):

- What it is: When sensitive data, such as passwords or credit card numbers, is not adequately protected, it can be accessed and exploited by attackers.
- Example: Storing passwords in plain text, not encrypting sensitive data.
## XML External Entities (XXE) (A4):

- What it is: XXE occurs when an application processes XML input with external entity references, allowing attackers to disclose internal files and execute remote code.
- Example: Uploading malicious XML files to exploit vulnerabilities.
## Broken Access Control (A5):

- What it is: Inadequate access controls can lead to unauthorized users gaining access to sensitive functionality or data.
- Example: Accessing another user's account, privilege escalation.
## Security Misconfigurations (A6):

- What it is: Security settings that are not properly configured can expose vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.
- Example: Default credentials, open directories, unnecessary services.
## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (A7):

- What it is: XSS occurs when an application includes untrusted data on a web page, allowing attackers to execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser.
- Example: Injecting malicious scripts in input fields to steal user data.
## Insecure Deserialization (A8):

- What it is: Deserialization is the process of converting data from a serialized format back into an object. Insecure deserialization can lead to remote code execution.
- Example: Tampering with serialized objects to execute malicious code.
## Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities (A9):

- What it is: Using outdated or vulnerable third-party components can expose applications to known security flaws.
- Example: Not updating libraries or frameworks with known security patches.
## Insufficient Logging & Monitoring (A10):

- What it is: Inadequate logging and monitoring make it difficult to detect and respond to security incidents in a timely manner.
- Example: Failing to log failed login attempts or not monitoring for suspicious activities.


Understanding and addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for creating secure web applications. Regularly updating and patching systems, employing secure coding practices, and conducting security assessments are essential steps in mitigating these risks.
