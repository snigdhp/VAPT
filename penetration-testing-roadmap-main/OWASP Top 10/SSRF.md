# Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a security vulnerability that allows an attacker to make requests to a server on behalf of the vulnerable server itself. It's like tricking a waiter into bringing you a dish from the kitchen without the chef's knowledge â€“ the server is unknowingly making requests on behalf of the attacker.


## What is Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)?
SSRF occurs when an attacker can manipulate a web application into making requests to other resources on the server or even to external systems, often behind the scenes.

## Common Scenarios of SSRF

- Fetching Internal Resources: It's like telling the waiter to bring you a secret menu item only available to the kitchen staff. An attacker might trick the server into accessing sensitive internal resources that it shouldn't be able to reach.

- Probing External Systems: Similar to asking the waiter to bring you dishes from a neighboring restaurant. Attackers might use SSRF to scan and interact with external systems, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data exposure.

## Why is SSRF a Problem?
SSRF can lead to serious security issues, such as unauthorized access to internal resources, exposure of sensitive information, or even remote code execution on the server. It's like having a waiter who can bring you anything from anywhere, including things you shouldn't have access to.

## Preventing SSRF
Developers can prevent SSRF by validating and sanitizing user inputs, especially when they involve making requests to external resources. Firewalls and network-level protections can also be implemented to restrict access to internal resources.

Server-Side Request Forgery is included in the OWASP Top 10 because it's a prevalent and potentially severe security issue. Just as you wouldn't want a waiter who can bring anything without proper checks, web applications need to ensure that user input is carefully validated to prevent unauthorized requests and protect against SSRF vulnerabilities.
