# Broken Access Control
Broken Access Control is a security issue that arises when a web application doesn't properly enforce restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do. In simpler terms, it means that users can perform actions or access information that they shouldn't be able to.

## What is Access Control?
Access control is like having different levels of access to different rooms in your house. In a web application, it refers to rules and mechanisms that determine who can do what within the system. For example, regular users may not have access to sensitive administrative functions.

## Common Broken Access Control Scenarios
- Unauthorized Access: It's like someone without the right key getting into a restricted room. Broken Access Control might allow a regular user to access or modify information meant only for administrators.
- Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR): This is like manipulating the address on your mail to access someone else's letter. Broken Access Control can result in insecure direct object references, allowing users to access data they are not supposed to by changing parameters in the URL.
- Missing Function-Level Access Control: It's like having a button that anyone can press, even if they shouldn't. Broken Access Control may occur when developers forget to check whether a user has the right permissions for a particular function or operation.

## Why is Broken Access Control a Problem?
If a web application doesn't properly control access, it's like having doors with broken locks. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security issues. Sensitive information may be exposed, and users might be able to perform actions they shouldn't.

## Preventing Broken Access Control
Developers need to ensure that every user action is properly authenticated and authorized. This involves setting up and enforcing proper access controls, regularly testing the application for vulnerabilities, and promptly fixing any issues that are identified.

In summary, Broken Access Control is like having a flaw in the system's security gates. It's a critical issue in web security, and developers need to be aware of it to ensure that users can only access the information and functionalities that they are supposed to. Properly implemented access controls are fundamental to a secure web application.
