# Methodology and Data

## Overview

Since the AppSec industry has not been specifically focused on the most recent
architecture of applications, in which APIs play an important role, compiling a
list of the ten most critical API security risks, based on a public call for
data, would have been a hard task. Despite there being no public data call, the
resulting Top 10 list is still based on publicly available data, security
experts' contributions, and open discussion with the security community.

## Methodology

In the first phase, publicly available data about APIs security incidents were
collected, reviewed, and categorized by a group of security experts. Such
data was collected from bug bounty platforms and vulnerability databases,
within a one-year-old time frame. It was used for statistical purposes.

In the next phase, security practitioners with penetration testing experience
were asked to compile their own Top 10 list.

The [OWASP Risk Rating Methodology][1] was used to perform he Risk Analysis. The
scores were discussed and reviewed between the security practitioners. For
considerations on these matters, please refer to the [API Security Risks][2]
section.

The first draft of the OWASP API Security Top 10 2019 resulted from a consensus
between statistical results from phase one, and the security practitioners'
lists. This draft was then submitted for appreciation and review by another
group of security practitioners, with relevant experience in the API security
fields.

The OWASP API Security Top 10 2019 was first presented in the OWASP Global
AppSec Tel Aviv event (May 2019). Since then, it has been available on GitHub
for public discussion and contributions.

The list of contributors is available in the [Acknowledgments][3] section.
