# API1:2019 Broken Object Level Authorization

| Threat agents/Attack vectors | Security Weakness | Impacts |

| API Specific : Exploitability **3** | Prevalence **3** : Detectability **2** | Technical **3** : Business Specific |
| Attackers can exploit API endpoints that are vulnerable to broken object level authorization by manipulating the ID of an object that is sent within the request. This may lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data. This issue is extremely common in API-based applications because the server component usually does not fully track the client’s state, and instead, relies more on parameters like object IDs, that are sent from the client to decide which objects to access. | This has been the most common and impactful attack on APIs. Authorization and access control mechanisms in modern applications are complex and wide-spread. Even if the application implements a proper infrastructure for authorization checks, developers might forget to use these checks before accessing a sensitive object. Access control detection is not typically amenable to automated static or dynamic testing. | Unauthorized access can result in data disclosure to unauthorized parties, data loss, or data manipulation. Unauthorized access to objects can also lead to full account takeover. |

## Is the API Vulnerable?

Object level authorization is an access control mechanism that is usually
implemented at the code level to validate that one user can only access objects
that they should have access to.

Every API endpoint that receives an ID of an object, and performs any type of
action on the object, should implement object level authorization checks. The
checks should validate that the logged-in user does have access to perform the
requested action on the requested object.

Failures in this mechanism typically leads to unauthorized information
disclosure, modification, or destruction of all data.

## Example Attack Scenarios

### Scenario #1

An e-commerce platform for online stores (shops) provides a listing page with
the revenue charts for their hosted shops. Inspecting the browser requests, an
attacker can identify the API endpoints used as a data source for those charts
and their pattern `/shops/{shopName}/revenue_data.json`. Using another API
endpoint, the attacker can get the list of all hosted shop names. With a simple
script to manipulate the names in the list, replacing `{shopName}` in the URL,
the attacker gains access to the sales data of thousands of e-commerce stores.

### Scenario #2

While monitoring the network traffic of a wearable device, the following HTTP
`PATCH` request gets the attention of an attacker due to the presence of a
custom HTTP request header `X-User-Id: 54796`. Replacing the `X-User-Id` value
with `54795`, the attacker receives a successful HTTP response, and is able to
modify other users' account data.

## How To Prevent

* Implement a proper authorization mechanism that relies on the user policies
  and hierarchy.
* Use an authorization mechanism to check if the logged-in user has access to
  perform the requested action on the record in every function that uses an
  input from the client to access a record in the database.
* Prefer to use random and unpredictable values as GUIDs for records’ IDs.
* Write tests to evaluate the authorization mechanism. Do not deploy vulnerable
  changes that break the tests.
